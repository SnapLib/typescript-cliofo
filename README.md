# Cliofo (Command Line Interface Operand Flag Option)

\*\*\* THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY IN ALPHA STATUS AND DOES NOT HAVE ALL FEATURES IMPLEMENTED AND WILL LIKELY GO THROUGH \*\*\*
<br> \*\*\* BREAKING CHANGES! \*\*\*

npm package to implement a command line interface argument parser in a
conventional GNU way. This API is built around the concept of a single leading
prefix character denoting ***flag*** arguments, 2 leading adjacent identical
characters denoting ***option*** arguments, and no leading prefix characters
denoting ***operand*** arguments.

## Installing

```bash
npm i cliofo
```
